# Exercise Reflection

Answer the following prompts in preperation for our class discussion about this exercise.

## Explain your decisions to create your task topic files. What was your reasoning?

My goal was to stay as user-oriented as possible, focusing on the "how-to" questions that the DITA modules highlighted to make sure the content models serves the users. 
## Explain your decisions to translate the tasks from the website, noting any changes to the original. What was your reasoning?


## Explain your difficulties. What parts of the process created some pain points for you? Why?
I keep getting errors in my code, and even when I make the fixes needed, they still appear, or it claims I don't have elements matching even though I have a beginning and end for each one. 

## How did you overcome those pain points?
I troubleshooted at night, was not registering it, and needed to sleep to not start the week off on the wrong foot. In the morining, I woke up to troubleshoot some more, messing with the beginning and end cases. Nothing was working. Overall feeling defeated with this project.
