# Exercise Reflection

Answer the following prompts in preperation for our class discussion about this exercise.

## Explain your decisions to create your task topic files. What was your reasoning?

My goal was to stay as user-oriented as possible, focusing on the "how-to" questions that the DITA modules highlighted to make sure the content models serves the users.

## Explain your decisions to translate the tasks from the website, noting any changes to the original. What was your reasoning?
I wanted to include the definitions as a glossentry, but after trying that, realized that technically isn't considered a task, which means it did not align with the task template in the original copy. I already have one dita file that doesn't look like the others but after troubleshooting coding problems somehow had no errors, and I do not want to break something if it works. 

## Explain your difficulties. What parts of the process created some pain points for you? Why?
I kept getting ordering errors in my code, and even when I make the fixes needed, they still appeared, After trying to troubleshoot overnight, I realized what I probably needed was sleep. I woke up the next morning and fixed my order heiracrchy errors in less than 5 minutes.

## How did you overcome those pain points?
I troubleshooted at night, was not registering it, and needed to sleep to not start the week off on the wrong foot. In the morining, I woke up to troubleshoot some more, messing with the beginning and end cases. Nothing was working. When I woke up, I was able to solve my problem. I have a bad habit of being harsh on myself before solving problems. This. shows that I just need to exercise more patience with myself to get through the issues!
