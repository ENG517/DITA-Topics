# Exercise Reflection

Answer the following prompts in preperation for our class discussion about this exercise.

## Explain your decisions to create your concept topic files. What was your reasoning?

I feel like this was pretty straight forward. I already isolated the task topics last week, so this was just using the remaining info to come up with concept topics by dividing it between conceptual and reference information.

## Explain your decisions to translate the concepts from the website, noting any changes to the original. What was your reasoning?

I didn't change anything major. Again, this was just about dividing up the remaining parts after the task topics.

## Explain your difficulties. What parts of the process created some pain points for you? Why?

The only difficulty I had was figuring out which tags to use for each section. 


## How did you overcome those pain points?

Even though multiple tags/sections could satisfy the needs of concept topic, I went with the ones that I felt _best fit_ what the concept was describing.
