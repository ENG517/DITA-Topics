# Exercise Reflection

Answer the following prompts in preperation for our class discussion about this exercise.

## Explain your decisions to create your task topic files. What was your reasoning?

I went through both webpages, assessed the content, and tried to draw imaginary lines separating the content into procedures. I know each task topic only gets one procedure and shouldn't be too long, so I took those things into account when deciding which content could be grouped together into one task topic. For example, on the "Personal Information and Privacy" page, I knew that setting privacy restrictions was its own task topic because it had a header, a short list of ordered steps, and imperative verbs. I originally had 6-7 sections, but upon a second review, I decided the content only needed 4 sections, 2 per page; for the address page, it was "Add Address" and "Update Address", and for the personal info page, it was "Restrict Personal Information" and "View Personal Info". 

## Explain your decisions to translate the tasks from the website, noting any changes to the original. What was your reasoning?

The biggest change I made was separating the "add address" and "update address" sections into two different tasks. I did this because the two things, while related, aren't explicitly connected and work better as separate tasks. I also ultimately chose not to include the different types of addresses, and to put the list of types of personal info in as a note in the 'view personal info' task instead of giving it its own task file. I chose to do this because I felt these bits of content didn't need their own sections (and, in the case of the addresses, wasn't necessary to include). Aside from this, everything else I did was a pretty straightforward translation. 


## Explain your difficulties. What parts of the process created some pain points for you? Why?

I had some difficulty deciding whether to include the first part of each webpage as a task topic, i.e. the address definitions and the list of different types of personal details shown on MyPack. They were more difficult for me to make a decision on because they're not ordered lists and don't have imperative verbs or steps included, making it slightly less straightforward than the other task topics I made. There were also moments where I had difficulties in deciding which pieces of content to include as context or as info notes rather than as steps. 

## How did you overcome those pain points?

I initially approached the first pain point by making separate task topics for those info lists, but I later decided not to use these at all. Instead, my solution was to include the list of personal info as an info note, and to not include the list of address types at all. For my other difficulty, I aimed for readability and a logical ordering of my information; if it looked better and felt more reasonable to include something as an <info> note rather than as a step, then that's what I did.
