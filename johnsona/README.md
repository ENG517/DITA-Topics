# Exercise Reflection

Answer the following prompts in preperation for our class discussion about this exercise.

## Explain your decisions to create your task topic files. What was your reasoning?

I went through both webpages, assessed the content, and tried to draw imaginary lines separating the content into procedures. I know each task topic only gets one procedure and shouldn't be too long, so I took those things into account when deciding which content could be grouped together into one task topic. For example, on the "Personal Information and Privacy" page, I knew that setting privacy restrictions was its own task topic because it had a header, a short list of ordered steps, and imperative verbs. I also decided to include the "definition" sections of the pages (for the privacy page it was the different types of personal info available on MyPackPortal and for the address one it was the different types of addresses) since those also aim to complete a task, that being the task of defining/explaining key concepts. 

## Explain your decisions to translate the tasks from the website, noting any changes to the original. What was your reasoning?


## Explain your difficulties. What parts of the process created some pain points for you? Why?


## How did you overcome those pain points?
