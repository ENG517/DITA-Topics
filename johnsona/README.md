# Exercise Reflection

Answer the following prompts in preperation for our class discussion about this exercise.

## Explain your decisions to create your task topic files. What was your reasoning?

I went through both webpages, assessed the content, and tried to draw imaginary lines separating the content into procedures. I know each task topic only gets one procedure and shouldn't be too long, so I took those things into account when deciding which content could be grouped together into one task topic. For example, on the "Personal Information and Privacy" page, I knew that setting privacy restrictions was its own task topic because it had a header, a short list of ordered steps, and imperative verbs. I also decided to include the "definition" sections of the pages (for the privacy page it was the different types of personal info available on MyPackPortal and for the address one it was the different types of addresses) since those also aim to complete a task, that being the task of defining/explaining key concepts. 

## Explain your decisions to translate the tasks from the website, noting any changes to the original. What was your reasoning?

Most of my decisions were pretty straightforward and aligned well with the website's choices (for example, choosing to have a task topic for explaining different types of addresses to the user), but one significant change I made from the original was separating the "add or update an address" task topic into two separate task topics. I chose to do this because each task topic is decently long (6 steps apiece, 12 steps altogether) already and while the two things are related, they're not the same, so they each warrant a dedicated task topic. 


## Explain your difficulties. What parts of the process created some pain points for you? Why?

I had some difficulty deciding whether to include the first part of each webpage as a task topic, i.e. the address definitions and the list of different types of personal details shown on MyPack. They were more difficult for me to make a decision on because they're not ordered lists and don't have imperative verbs or steps included, making it slightly less straightforward than the other task topics I made. 

## How did you overcome those pain points?

I overcame this difficulty by creating task topics for those sections and naming them imperatively. I felt like that info was essential to include for the sake of the user's understanding, and I think these specific task topics from each webpage can be rephrased or repositioned to be more apparent as task topics.
