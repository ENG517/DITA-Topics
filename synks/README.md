# Exercise Reflection

Answer the following prompts in preperation for our class discussion about this exercise.

## Explain your decisions to create your task topic files. What was your reasoning?
I created 4 task topic files. 

On the personal information and privacy page, there were 2 tasks: 1. View Your personal information which I named "t_view_personal_info.dita", and 2. The header for this one is called "Directory Information Privacy Settings" but the actual task itself is how to update your privacy settings. Since I work in administration at the university, I know that this is almost exclusively referred to as "FERPA", an acronym for the federal legislation mandating students to have an option to refuse to make their name and personal information public in things like graduation programs. Knowing this, and wanting to make a more concise title, I named this task "t_update_ferpa.dita".

For the "Student Adresses" page, I created 2 task topics. On this page, there were two  Header 2's -- one named "address definitions" and another named "add or update an address". I considered "address definitions" to be a reference topic, not a task topic, because it was simply a list of definitions. Under the second header, here were two tasks, each with a numbered list of subtasks. As the header implies, one task was for adding an address, which I named "t_add_address.dita". The other task was for updating an address, which I named "t_update_address.dita"

So, in summary, I created for tasks:
- t_view_personal_info.dita
- t_update_ferpa.dita
- t_add_address.dita
- t_update_address.dita
