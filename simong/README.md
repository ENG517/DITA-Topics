# Exercise Reflection

Answer the following prompts in preperation for our class discussion about this exercise.

## Explain your decisions to create your task topic files. What was your reasoning?
As I viewed the webpages, I separated each topic by significant action. There were two areas of direct instruction for each webpage: how to view and restrict information and how to add and update your address. I used these four to separate and title my task topics.

## Explain your decisions to translate the tasks from the website, noting any changes to the original. What was your reasoning?
I addressed the prerequisites that weren't explicitally outlined in the webpages. While they did address where the user needed to be before starting the task, it was not visually distinct. Many of the steps included additional information, so I changed the word ordering of some of the steps so that the actionable step came first, then included the additional information in the info tags. I put the introductory paragraphs or a brief address of their starting point in the context tags. I also included a context tag for a note and the end of the 'restrict information' file. Since it wasn't a postreq or example, I decided to add it in a context tag. For both tasks that I address in the 'view information' file, I created context tags to introduce each task.

## Explain your difficulties. What parts of the process created some pain points for you? Why?
For my 'view information' file, I wasn't sure if I should separate the two tasks that I found into separate files, since the first task led into the second one and only seemed to guide the reader to perform the second task. I kept them together and separated them into two steps. I also had trouble with creating unordered steps in the 'view information' file. I kept recieving the red underlined error alert, which gave me reason for concern. My first taskbody tag in each file also have a red underlined error alert, but I am not sure how to fix that.

## How did you overcome those pain points?

Based on the feedback I recieve, I may separate the 'view information' file into two task files. For the unordered steps that I couldn't create, I will address this concern in class to identify if there are ways that I can successfully update this in my file. I will also add postreqs as needed, depending on if we need to create content for that.
