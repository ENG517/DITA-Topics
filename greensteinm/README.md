# Exercise Reflection

Answer the following prompts in preperation for our class discussion about this exercise.

## Explain your decisions to create your task topic files. What was your reasoning?

I created three task topics: add an address, update an address, and restrict personal information. There was room for a reference topic (types of addresses), but that wasn't part of this assignment. 

## Explain your decisions to translate the tasks from the website, noting any changes to the original. What was your reasoning?

I kept the text the same, as I thought it had been previously copyedited by NC State teams. The only change I had to make was converting the apostrophes from what copied from the source text into this character " ' ". 

## Explain your difficulties. What parts of the process created some pain points for you? Why?

I had trouble remembering the order of elements (ex. steps, step, cmd, info). I kept copying the command text into the step without actually giving myself the space for the command.

## How did you overcome those pain points?

I revisited the videos from Scriptorium and had my completed task topics split-screened with the one I was currently working on. I also gave myself more space than was maybe necessary by splitting the "step" element by a couple lines and keeping the "cmd" element on one line to keep everything organized in my head.
