# Exercise Reflection

Answer the following prompts in preperation for our class discussion about this exercise.

## Explain your decisions to create your concept topic files. What was your reasoning?
This was a little tough, because much of the content seemed like a task. But in order to create 3 topics, I created one concept for the student addresses page. Then, from the Student Personal Information and Privacy page, I created two topics: one for personal information, and one for privacy.

## Explain your decisions to translate the concepts from the website, noting any changes to the original. What was your reasoning?
The main change I made was breaking up the header "Personal Information and Privacy" into two concepts: 1. Personal Information and 2. Privacy.

## Explain your difficulties. What parts of the process created some pain points for you? Why?
Student addresses seemed self explanatory. I created a conbody and added a definition list. For the personal information, I included the list on the webpage as an unordered list. The privacy settings section was difficult, since it contained a numbered list, which seemed to essentially be a task. But I decided to create a concept out of this, including the descriptive material in a section, using the header as the title, and adding the paragraph material underneath using the <p> command.

## How did you overcome those pain points?
I felt like these were pretty short. I might have organized this a different way, but for the sake of creating 3 concepts for this exercise, I feel my logic described above made sense.
