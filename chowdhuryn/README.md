# Exercise Reflection

Answer the following prompts in preperation for our class discussion about this exercise.

## Explain your decisions to create your task topic files. What was your reasoning?

First, I've identified three distinct procedures with numbered steps and then created three task topics. In one webpage, the 'Add Address' and 'Update Address' tasks have different user goals. So, I separated them by following 'one task per topic'. For the another webpage, I created 'Restrict Directory Privacy' as it had own procedure with 6 numbered steps.


## Explain your decisions to translate the tasks from the website, noting any changes to the original. What was your reasoning?

I've added prerequisite sections because the websites didn't clearly state that users need login access. I also used the <choices> element when there were options like choosing between copying an address or entering it manually. Additionally, I also added short descriptions that explain the purpose and importance of the each task.

## Explain your difficulties. What parts of the process created some pain points for you? Why?

At firts, I thought 'View Your Personal Information' was a task and was confused about whether navigation path alone could be task topics. I also had confusion where to put the full privacy block note. At first, I was considering adding it under that particular step. Like- <step>, <cmd>, <info>, <note>. As a result, the <cmd> had too much content but it should contain one clear, concise action. 

## How did you overcome those pain points?

After reviewing the Dita guideline, my understanding was- Task topics need actual procedural steps with action verbs. However, the 'View Your Personal Information' section didn't actually direct how to complete a task. So, I ended up not adding it as a task topic. For the 'Note' part- as it felt too much content in one <cmd>, after checking task topic cheatsheet, I decided to put the note under the <postreq> element.
