# Exercise Reflection

Answer the following prompts in preperation for our class discussion about this exercise.

## Explain your decisions to create your task topic files. What was your reasoning?
I ended up creating four separate task files. For the *student addresses* document I separated the two tasks by "adding address" and "updating address". I felt both of these delineated a single topic and contained more than enough information to stand on their own. Plus if both were to be combined they would have surpassed the **10 step** threshold discussed by Bellamy et. al. 

The *personal information and privacy* document was a little bit tougher to parse. The "view your personal information" header did not contain clear, sequential steps underneath, but rather examples of the information contained in the "personal information tile." The "Directory Information Privacy Settings" was more of a textbook task-based procedure, with a numbered list of these steps. I chose to separate the two because I felt there would of been multiple topics present if I tried to combine them. Even though the restricting personal information task contains info on how first view the same info, it is not the express intent of the procedure or primary *goal* to convey this information.

## Explain your decisions to translate the tasks from the website, noting any changes to the original. What was your reasoning?
For the "Directory Information Privacy Settings" task, I chose to change the wording to "restricting directory info." This change reflected the body and steps of the task, and the title was too feature-focused to make sense in the context of a task analysis. 

Most of the changing of language in the actual steps or task body was contextual and meant to accomodate whichever relevant elemant was used.

## Explain your difficulties. What parts of the process created some pain points for you? Why?
There were a couple instances I wasn't sure how to tag. Specifically, regarding alerting stages I wasn't sure exactly which elements were appropriate and presented enough of a break from the steps > step > cmd cadence frequently used.

Also, there were a few elements that were not autopopulating that were either in the "Hierachy of Task Elements" or video posted, and I wasn't sure if I should move forward using them. The <uicontrol> element was a big example of this.

## How did you overcome those pain points?
I tried to work with the elements I understand and am comfortable with at this stage of Dita use. I am excited to learn more applications of elements to better tag more components of documents.
