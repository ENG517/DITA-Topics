# Exercise Reflection

Answer the following prompts in preperation for our class discussion about this exercise.

## Explain your decisions to create your task topic files. What was your reasoning?
* For ‘Personal Information and Privacy’: chose to make task topics out of accessing personal information. One is how to view personal information, and the other is changing the privacy settings and restricting access to that personal information.

* For ‘Student Addresses’: chose to make adding and updated addresses 2 different topics. The procedures are similar, but they deal with two different states of addresses: no defined address and updating a defined address.


## Explain your decisions to translate the tasks from the website, noting any changes to the original. What was your reasoning?
* For ‘Personal Information and Privacy’: Viewing personal information wasn’t really presented as a task with steps, other than a one-line summary of how to access the personal information tile in MyPack portal. I turned the one-line summary into steps for a task topic. Accessing that tile is also necessary for changing any personal information and privacy settings, but it had defined steps that I moved over to the task topic.

* For ‘Student Addresses’: A lot of address information on the page is about the different types of addresses that can be changed and updated in the system. All of that info, to me, is reference information, and therefore not a part of the task topic. Both things I chose as task topics, updating and adding addresses, are accessed in the same way: through the Address section of the Personal Information tile in MyPack. So the majority of instructions for each task are.


## Explain your difficulties. What parts of the process created some pain points for you? Why?
* For ‘Personal Information and Privacy’: figuring out what can/should be a task, how to format it correctly, and what info should be included as <step> or <info> or <shortdesc> or just left out. There’s a whole list of the personal info that can be viewed/accessed on the personal information page, but all of that information isn’t task-related or necessary to the task, and better fits as a reference topic, which wasn’t included in this assignment.
	
*  For ‘Student Addresses’: Trying to figure out where to put/how to classify needing to be logged into MyPack portal to change addresses. It could be step one, or it could be a prerequisite.

	* Part of the point of using XML is recycling/reusing chunks of information, and the first few steps of the address process (up until you either have to enter new address info or update existing address info) is the same for both adding and updated addresses. I did that by copy/pasting it, but we talked about ways to link it etc in class (which is why it’s easier for maintenance and updating–update one, update them all) but I don’t know how to do that. But this really showed me how it can be helpful to have topics with specific scopes that can easily be utilized in multiple places.


## How did you overcome those pain points?
* For ‘Personal Information and Privacy’: I left out the list of all the personal information that could be accessed and updated/changed in the Personal Info tile. This assignment is about creating task topics, not reference or concept topics.

* For ‘Student Addresses’: I wrote the Add Address task topic, and then copied the majority of the instructions to the Update Address topic, because the tasks were so similar. The process of laying out the add address topic helped me revise my initial layout, and then have a faster, easier time creating the update address topic.
