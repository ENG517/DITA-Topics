# Exercise Reflection

Answer the following prompts in preperation for our class discussion about this exercise.

## Explain your decisions to create your task topic files. What was your reasoning?

The two main decisions I made were to include only the section on restricting information from the Personal Information and Privacy page, and to split the adding and updating addresses section from the Student Addresses page into two task topics. For the first, the section on restricting information was the only part of that webpage that constituted a task topic - the first section I would put into a concept topic, or potentially a reference topic. For the second, even though adding and updating addresses were grouped under one section on the website, they are two separate (if similar) tasks that warrant their own topics.

## Explain your decisions to translate the tasks from the website, noting any changes to the original. What was your reasoning?

The main change I made was to strictly make the first word in every step an imperative verb. That required some restructuring of the sentences so they still flowed well, but I think it made a difference in the consistency of the tasks.

## Explain your difficulties. What parts of the process created some pain points for you? Why?

It went a lot more smooth than I anticipated - I knew some DITA already since I work in XML in Oxygen at SAS, so the learning curve wasn't very steep. But there were some things I wasn't anticipating, like in the restrict information topic I wanted to add a note to a step, but the valid DITA required the note element to come before the cmd element, even though I think it would flow better to have the note after the step info.

## How did you overcome those pain points?

I just did what the validator told me to do, I still don't quite get why it is structured that way, but maybe it will make more sense as we dig into DITA more.
